# Welcome to Temporal Cryptophysics

**A new foundation for digital trust — with deterministic time, signed records, and immutable history.**

> What if you could prove exactly when something happened, who signed it, and what it meant — forever?

This is **Trust Architecture** — a cryptographically verifiable system for **time**, **identity**, and **truth** built from first principles.

---

## ⏱️ The 30-Second Version

-   **Genesis Time (GT)** is a deterministic, sidereal-based timestamp system. Every record has a _verifiable clock value_.
-   **R⬢ Records** are append-only, hash-linked, Ed25519-signed data structures with scope-based identity and full canonicalization.
-   **Scopes** define authority and nested domains of trust — from sovereign identities to public ledgers.
-   **No tokens. No consensus layer. No blockchain noise.** Just pure, tamper-evident causality.

### 🧠 Core Concepts

-   [Temporal Cryptophysics](./temporal-cryptophysics) — the philosophy and scientific framework
-   [Genesis Clock](./genesis-clock) — how Genesis Time works, and how to compute it
-   [R⬢ (Rhex) Format](./rhex-format) — the canonical record format used across all systems
-   [Scope and Truth](./scope-and-truth) — how nested authority works

### 🔐 Identity + Signing

-   [SelfID](./selfid) — sovereign identity on the ledger
-   [Hodo Trust](./hodo-trust) — the ethical foundation of the system
-   [Manifesto](./manifesto) — why this was created, and who it's for

### 📦 Live Proof

-   [Sample Records](./sample-records) — signed and linked ledger records
-   [genesis.md](./genesis.md) — the first record (`R⬢:///genesis`)
-   [Time Crystal](./ledger-as-time-crystal) — the system as a cryptographic memory of the world

### ❓ Questions & Language
