**Credits:** 3

**Delivery Mode:** Lecture, labs, and real-time ledger immersion

**Prerequisites:** Curiosity, critical thought, basic comfort with code and computation

## üóå Course Description

This course introduces **Temporal Cryptophysics**, a new scientific and computational discipline rooted in absolute time and immutable truth. Students will learn the **HodeauxLedger**, operate inside the **Genesis Time (GT)** system, and master the design and issuance of verifiable truth objects ‚Äî R‚¨¢ (Rhex records) ‚Äî that replace unverifiable claims across industries.

This is the architecture of a post-zero-trust world. It is not theory. It runs now.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

-   Operate with full fluency in GT time, including GT floats and structured form (Sol.Luna.Turn\@Mark)
-   Author and interpret R‚¨¢ records using the canonical Rhex format
-   Cast a local Genesis and deploy scoped ledgers
-   Create and sign decentralized identity claims using the SelfID model
-   Understand the implications of ledgers as causal chains in science, law, and economics
-   Develop real-world use cases backed by cryptographic proof
